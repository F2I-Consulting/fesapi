	 * @brief	Proxy class for a sub-representation. A sub representation is an ordered list of
	 * 			indexable elements and/or indexable element pairs of an existing representation.
	 * 			
	 * 			Because the representation concepts of topology, geometry, and property values are
	 * 			separate in RESQML, it is now possible to select a range of nodes, edges, faces, or
	 * 			volumes (cells) indices from the topological support of an existing representation to
	 * 			define a sub-representation. A sub- representation may describe a different feature
	 * 			interpretation using the same geometry or property as the "parent" representation. In
	 * 			this case, the only information exchanged is a set of potentially non-consecutive
	 * 			indices of the topological support of the representation.
