	* An ordered list of indexable elements and/or indexable element pairs of an existing representation. 
	* Because the representation concepts of topology, geometry, and property values are separate in RESQML, it is now possible to select a range of nodes, edges, faces, or volumes (cell) indices from the topological support of an existing representation to define a sub-representation.
	* A sub-representation may describe a different feature interpretation using the same geometry or property as the "parent" representation. In this case, the only information exchanged is a set of potentially non-consecutive indices of the topological support of the representation.
