		 *
		 * @param 		  	mostComplexPillarGeometry					The most complex pillar geometry
		 * 																which occurs on this reservoir grid.
		 * @param 		  	kDirectionKind								The direction of the K axis on
		 * 																the earth. It is not directly related
		 * 																to Z of the vertical CRS but to the
		 * 																physical earth (as the vertical CRS
		 * 																is).
		 * @param 		  	isRightHanded								Indicates that the IJK grid is
		 * 																right handed, as determined by the
		 * 																triple product of tangent vectors in
		 * 																the I, J, and K directions.
		 * @param [in]	  	points										XYZ double triplets ordered by i
		 * 																then j then split then k. Count must
		 * 																be <tt>((iCellCount+1) *
		 * 																(jCellCount+1) +
		 * 																splitCoordinateLineCount) *
		 * 																kCellCount</tt>.
		 * @param [in,out]	proxy										(Optional) The HDF proxy where
		 * 																all numerical values will be stored.
		 * 																If @c nullptr, then the default HDF
		 * 																proxy of the repository will be used.
		 * @param 		  	splitCoordinateLineCount					(Optional) The count of split
		 * 																coordinate line. A grid pillar is
		 * 																splitted in up to 4 coordinate lines.
		 * @param [in]	  	pillarOfCoordinateLine						(Optional) For each split
		 * 																coordinate line, indicates which
		 * 																pillar it belongs to. Pillars are
		 * 																identified by their absolute 1d index
		 * 																<tt>(iPillar + jPillar *
		 * 																iPillarCount)</tt> where
		 * 																<tt>iPillarCount ==
		 * 																iCellCount+1</tt>. Count is
		 * 																splitCoordinateLineCount.
		 * @param [in]	  	splitCoordinateLineColumnCumulativeCount	(Optional) For each split
		 * 																coordinate line, indicates how many
		 * 																columns of the ijk grid are incident
		 * 																to it (minimum is one and maximum is
		 * 																3) + the count of all incident
		 * 																columns of previous spit coordinate
		 * 																lines in the array. For example
		 * 																<tt>{1, 4, 6}</tt> would mean that
		 * 																the first split coordinate line is
		 * 																incident to only one column, the
		 * 																second split coordinate line is
		 * 																incident to <tt>4 - 1 = 3</tt>
		 * 																columns and the third column is
		 * 																incident to <tt>6 - 4 = 2</tt>
		 * 																columns. Count is
		 * 																splitCoordinateLineCount.
		 * @param [in]	  	splitCoordinateLineColumns					(Optional) For each split
		 * 																coordinate line, indicates which
		 * 																columns are incident to it. Count is
		 * 																the last value in the
		 * 																splitCoordinateLineColumnCumulativeCount
		 * 																array. Columns are identified by
		 * 																their absolute 1d index
		 * 																<tt>(iColumn</tt>
		 * 																<tt> + jColumn * iColumnCount)</tt>
		 * 																where
		 * 																Column == Cell.
		 * @param [in]	  	definedPillars								(Optional) For each pillar : 0 if
		 * 																pillar is not defined (i.e points
		 * 																equal to NaN) else the pillar is
		 * 																defined.  This information overrides
		 * 																any pillar geometry information. If
		 * 																null, then all pillars are assumed to
		 * 																be defined.
		 * @param [in]	  	localCrs									(Optional) The local CRS where
		 * 																the points are given. If @c nullptr
		 * 																(default) then the default CRS of the
		 * 																repository will be used.
