	 * @brief	A representation made up of a single polyline or "polygonal chain", which may be
	 * 			closed or not. See definition here:
	 * 			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_curve.
	 * 			
	 * 			BUSINESS RULE: To record a polyline the writer software must give the values of the
	 * 			geometry of each node in an order corresponding to the logical series of segments
	 * 			(edges). The geometry of a polyline must be a 1D array of points.
	 * 			
	 * 			A simple polygonal chain is one in which only consecutive (or the first and the last)
	 * 			segments intersect and only at their endpoints.
