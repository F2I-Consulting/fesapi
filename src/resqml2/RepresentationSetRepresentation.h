	 * @brief	Proxy class for a representation set representation. This is the parent class of the
	 * 			framework representations. It is used to group together individual representations to
	 * 			represent a "bag" of representations.
	 * 			
	 * 			If the individual representations are all of the same type, then you can indicate
	 * 			that the set is homogenous. These "bags" do not imply any geologic consistency. For
	 * 			example, you can define a set of wellbore frames, a set of wellbore trajectories, a
	 * 			set of blocked wellbores. Because the framework representations inherit from this
	 * 			class, they inherit the capability to gather individual representations into sealed
	 * 			and non-sealed surface framework representations, or sealed volume framework
	 * 			representations.
