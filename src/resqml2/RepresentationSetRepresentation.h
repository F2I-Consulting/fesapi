	* The parent class of the framework representations. It is used to group together individual representations to represent a “bag” of representations. If the individual representations are all of the same, then you can indicate that the set is homogenous.
	* These “bags” do not imply any geologic consistency. For example, you can define a set of wellbore frames, a set of wellbore trajectories, a set of blocked wellbores. 
	* Because the framework representations inherit from this class, they inherit the capability to gather individual representations into sealed and non-sealed surface framework representations, or sealed volume framework representations.
