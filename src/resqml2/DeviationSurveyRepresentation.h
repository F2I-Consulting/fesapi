	 * @brief	A deviation survey representation. It Specifies the station data from a deviation
	 * 			survey.
	 * 			
	 * 			The deviation survey does not provide a complete specification of the geometry of a
	 * 			wellbore trajectory. Although a minimum-curvature algorithm is used in most cases,
	 * 			the implementation varies sufficiently that no single algorithmic specification is
	 * 			available as a data transfer standard.
	 * 			
	 * 			Instead, the geometry of a RESQML wellbore trajectory is represented by a parametric
	 * 			line, parameterized by the MD.
	 * 			
	 * 			CRS and units of measure do not need to be consistent with the CRS and units of
	 * 			measure for wellbore trajectory representation.
