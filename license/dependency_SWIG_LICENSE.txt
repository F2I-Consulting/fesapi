All the files located in cs/src and java/src are generated (output) using SWIG (http://www.swig.org/).

-- FROM http://www.swig.org/legal.html --
 When SWIG is used as it is distributed by the SWIG developers, its output is not governed by SWIG's license (including the GPL). SWIG's output contains code from three sources:

    code generated by SWIG, which is not governed by copyright;
    code copied from the SWIG library which is permissively licensed to be redistributed without restriction;
    code derived from the user's input, which may be governed by the license of the code supplied by the user.

So, while the input supplied to SWIG may affect the license of SWIG's output (e.g. if the input code is licensed under a copyleft or proprietary license), SWIG's license does not affect the license of the output. This is consistent with the FSF's FAQ entries on this subject (GPLOutput and WhatCaseIsOutputGPL), because the SWIG code copied into the output by SWIG is not GPL-licensed.
